
Version 0.9.1
-------------

- Correctly validate public key passed to win_sparkle_set_eddsa_public_key().


Version 0.9.0
-------------

- Added support for EdDSA signatures.
- Added winsparkle-tool for performing signing operations.
- Deprecated DSA signatures. They are still supported, but will be removed in
  a future release and migrating to EdDSA a.s.a.p. is strongly recommended.
  DSA signing scripts are still included in the repository, but were renamed to
  legacy_*.bat to indicate their status.
- WinSparkle has a new updater icon.


Version 0.8.3
-------------

- Fixed <sparkle:minimumSystemVersion> parsing breakage introduced in 0.8.2.
- Also understand major.minor-build for <sparkle:minimumSystemVersion>.

  previously only much less useful major.minor.servicepack was used.

- Added support for ARM-specific enclosures.
- Fixed handling of multiple enclosures to correctly pick the most-specific
  binary available, and to use the latest available app version.
- Fixed feed parsing to ignore appcast order of items and instead find the
  highest compatible version.
- Call cancelled/dismissed callbacks when user closes WinSparkle's window.
